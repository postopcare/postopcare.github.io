        <title>Vaginal Flora</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;nobody-likes-a-smelly-vag-not-even-ourselves&quot;&gt;Nobody likes a smelly vag, not even ourselves&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our newly installed neovagina and neovulva do not have the flora native to natal vulvas and ladybits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because throughout the process of surgery and aftercare, the surgeons douse us liberally with antiseptics to prevent infection, and thereafter, we are usually on a dose of antibiotics, which presumably kill off almost &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; flora…except the stinky ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One sure sign that we are getting a yeast infection is an unpleasant smell. If our vag stinks like ass, a rotten fish, or even marmite / vegemite, it’s likely we got ourselves a B.V. aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_vaginosis&quot;&gt;bacterial vaginosis&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately one of the &lt;em&gt;leading causes&lt;/em&gt; of B.V. is douching. Yup, that activity that surgeons sometimes encourage us to do to flush stuff out. It gets particularly bad if we use betadine or even vinegar as douching solutions because these stuff nuke our good flora along with the bad. The antibiotics we’re usually hopped up on postop don’t help much, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more acidophilus types in there, not less. There’s one good solution, which is to buy Intimate Hygiene Washes, particularly those with prebiotics or probiotics in them. The really high-end washes are pretty pricy and come in a foaming bottle but we can buy a foam-making bottle and pour (diluted) washing solution in there to max out our money, because the washing instructions pretty much always instruct users to foam before applying, which is tricky.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy those at Walmart for less than $5.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’ve made my small bottle last me a whole six months, washing twice a day!$5 never went anywhere as far in my life as this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advantages-of-not-being-malodorous&quot;&gt;Advantages of not being malodorous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mental Well-being – we can be further in harmony with our new anatomy after our painful rebirth, be more confident and not be so paranoid everyone is smelling fish when we enter the room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better physical well-being – yes, not having a rash or stinky discharge is pretty nice, plus we don’t have to scrub our undies that hard. whew. 
as&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Better love life – most lovers prefer ladybits which don’t smell offensive.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-should-we-start-or-when-is-it-okay-to-use-a-vaginal-wash&quot;&gt;When should we start or when is it okay to use a vaginal wash?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise indicated by your doctor, a good time would be pretty close to the end of your antiobiotic dosage, or when the offensive smell / discharge starts to appear, or when your stitches stop oozing. Usually that would be around the 6 week mark upwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also never too late to use a vaginal wash, no matter how many years postop a person is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please report on your results after trying this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot;&gt;
    &lt;img src=&quot;/img/post-sample-image.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Post Sample Image&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dinosaurs are extinct today</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all the directions eventually meet, in which there is no center because every point, or none, is center — an equal earth which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly round: a globe in practice, not in theory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come from science.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that they set eye on the earth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young girl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For those who have seen the Earth from space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;The Final Frontier&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There can be no thought of finishing for ‘aiming for the stars.’ Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matter how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The dreams of yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tomorrow. Science has not yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the next ten.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Spaceflights cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group of men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 class=&quot;section-heading&quot;&gt;Reaching for the Stars&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;span class=&quot;caption text-muted&quot;&gt;To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Space, the final frontier. These are the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. Its five-year mission: to explore strange new worlds, to seek out new life and new civilizations, to boldly go where no man has gone before.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As I stand out here in the wonders of the unknown at Hadley, I sort of realize there’s a fundamental truth to our nature, Man must explore, and this is exploration at its greatest.&lt;/p&gt;
