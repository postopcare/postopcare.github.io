        <title>How Often Should You Dilate? Let Your Body Tell You</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;its-been-a-year-and-more-out-for-me-since-srs-and-perhaps-you-too&quot;&gt;It’s been a year and more out for me since SRS (and perhaps you, too)&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The swelling has long gone down, the pain a vague memory. Life is good. No more genital dysphoria (mostly)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I no longer have to (although I &lt;em&gt;ought&lt;/em&gt; to) dilate on a daily basis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How often then should I dilate? Or, how often then should you dilate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let your body tell you. If you’re losing depth and/or width, that’s a sign that your vag isn’t getting enough
maintenance so get on it. A sign of losing depth of width is struggling to get the dilators you could previously
accommodate, to the depth you could, given a particular width. Or even simply struggling to get the dilator to enter
(of course having already used enough lube!!! &lt;em&gt;wince&lt;/em&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Increase the frequency of dilation until you don’t lose depth of width. For myself I did end up
dilating less frequently than every other day , which alarmingly made me lose width &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; depth. That was scary. I restarted
my dilation daily and slowly took it to alternate days, although some weeks, I do end up playing it safe and not skipping any days at all.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope you’re able to find your own balance between having a life and dilating! Happy dilating!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Dilation Hurts, any tips ?</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;ulivebetas-dilation-tips&quot;&gt;/u/livebeta’s dilation tips&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3wx55c/dilation_really_hurts_any_tips/&quot;&gt;original source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;a-recently-postoperative-woman-asked&quot;&gt;A recently postoperative woman asked:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tried dilation by myself for the first time today, the nurse kept telling me to relax my muscles but I don’t know how to do that when I’m in physical pain. Once it’s in there I’m ok but pushing it in is teeth grindingly hard. Any help would be very appreciated!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;/u/livebeta wrote:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Hi, (I’m a) Chet’s pussy owner. (here was what helped me in having easier dilations)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;deep breathing exercise. See youtube. Basically you breath in deeply over 1 bar of slow music (4 counts) and out over 4 counts. It’s similar to meditative breathing.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bear down. Make like you’re going to poop , that relaxes the muscles. Poop beforehand if you’re concerned that you may poo during dilation.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Half turns, quarter turns. Make sure you have enough lube. Apply pressure and turn/ twist dilator . If it pulls (hurts, no immediate slippage) when twisting, that means you don’t have enough lube. Remove dilator, reapply lube. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Take your time. You have the whole day to dilate a total of 30mins x 3. Don’t rush. Listen to some quiet, piano music on Youtube. That’s how I use music to track time elapsed. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Also, you need to note the exact angles Sri taught you to sit at, so that the dilator goes in. Try not to dilate having taken a powerful painkiller combo of Tramadol+Para, that kills off the feedback and you won’t know if you’re hurting yourself. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Add: breathing in will create abdominal space, push dilator in  when breathing in
Hope this helps. /u/hanazon0 – please upload this contribution~!&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

        <title>Travel Guide to Dr Suporn Chonburi</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;uisleeplikeacats-guide-to-chonburi&quot;&gt;/u/isleeplikeacat’s guide to Chonburi&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3vxgal/travel_guide_to_thailand_long_wall_of_text/&quot;&gt;original source&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;im-in-my-bed-bored-to-hell-these-last-few-hours-so-i-thought-i-could-type-a-list-of-suggestions-to-whoever-is-going-to-suporn&quot;&gt;I’m in my bed, bored to hell these last few hours, so I thought I could type a list of suggestions to whoever is going to Suporn.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case some girls are traveling in the next days, here’re my suggestions based on my actual experience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyone is free to copy/paste/do whatever with that list. You don’t even have to mention it was written by a cat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;at-home&quot;&gt;At home&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Buy a small spray bottle for betadine. Don’t bother with antibotics. You’ll find much better in Thailand.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Buy multiplugs and extension cords. Make sure they fit will together as some AC adapters have weird weird shapes. If you’re lucky you’ll have one plug in the hospital. You got to use it to your best.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My setup is: one extension cord : multiplug : computer ac adapter, usb adapter 1, usb adapter 2.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why 2 usb adapters? Because one may fail. Or be rated 220V but only take 110 and die on you. Also, take 2 cables of 2 different colors, one for each of your devices. When you are on morphine, this may be handy to realize which cable goes into which device.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also buy elastics, velcro cable wrap, plastic wrap and duct tape. That’s for your room. More on that later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You may want to get some nail care kit (cutter, acetone, etc) and plyiers but they will have to travel with your luggage. I forgot to take nail polish, and I really really want to fix the nails that had to be cleaned for anesthesia. I guess it will have to wait.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;plane&quot;&gt;Plane&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Only eat meat and potatotes/rice/pasta. No veggies from now on. You want your digestive system as clean as can be (that’s called a “no residue” or “low fiber” diet). When the nurse will clean your bowels, this will make the process faster. easier and less painful. But feel free to disregard that advice if you enjoy enemas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless you’re rich, you won’t be traveling first class and getting all their nice amenities. But when these people leave the plane, a lot of them first class travelers leave their nice bag of goodies. On air Korea, it’s a brown bag with toothpaste, facial cream, toothbrush, soap, airbrush+comb, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It would be sad to leave all that behind, so snatch one, as they will be thrown away when the plane is cleaned up. And it will be useful to you in the hospital.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;airport&quot;&gt;Airport&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When you arrive at the Bankgok airport, there are many shops selling cellphone plans. Most insist seeing your plane ticket and your passport. I absolutely hate my passport name so I had a hard time there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on your degree of persuasion and your generosity (giving some dollars wrapped around your driver license) they may agree to only use your ID instead of your passport. Just say it has the same number as the passport and that your passport is deep in your bag. They will insist on cash, pretending they don’t accept credit card (they do if you accept adding 3%). It’s part of a nice scam with the nearby shops changing at awful rates, but go with it and get one sim card. They’ve got to make a living, and if they’re willing to bend the rules a bit in my favor so that I can use my legal name, I’m willing to be nice to them in return :-)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The 3 big brands are AIS, DTAC and TRUE. After comparing the prices, I recommend DTAC next to exit 5 for 550 THB giving you 4GB at LTE speed for 1 month. Also, DTAC cover the Aikchol hospital at 4G speed, which has shitty wifi coverage. I use it for skype and google talk in high resolution. It works great!! If you want more data, pay more (DUH!). But I recommend getting multiple sim instead, so just get one with enough to get by.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They will put the simcard in your phone, activate it and test it. Thai service is great!! Of course, you need an unlocked phone. Can’t help you with that. Go to ebay before you leave the US lol.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chonburi&quot;&gt;Chonburi&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a big blue bridge, with a pizza shop on the other size. Next to the pizza shop is a TRUE mobile shop. Get a TRUE simcard giving you 4 Gigs for about 400 THB. The speed is not as great as DTAC, but you don’t want to be in a place where you don’t have coverage. Some places are covered by one network, some by the other. I like to play it safe. Having one sim of each network is best, especially if you have multiple devices (ex: ipad + cellphone)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One funny cultural thing: they will show you many possible numbers and ask you to pick one. That’s because some numbers bring bad luck. Take advantage of that to pick a number you like or that you will remember. Also, at least one person speak english in this store so you will not have any problem getting what you want. Just speak slowly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross back the bridge and keep walking towards the traffic lights. There is a big pharmacy selling absolutely anything you want, but OTC. Xanax, antibiotics, hormones, you name it, they got it. And prices are great, like $6 for a tube of estrogel. Buy enough for 3 month (or the US custom will not let you in) at this great great price! And if your health insurance is not that good, take advantage of that opportunity to get all the meds you regularly use. My antibiotic eyedrops have a $45 copay in the US, and require a prescription which carries its own $30 copay. I need them several times a year. Here the same eyedrops are $4, no question asked. So I got a few vials. Thank you Thailand! For antibiotic cream, I recommend bactroban and fuscidine in case you get an infection when you’re back in the US.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you purchased many things, once you have paid the pharmacist (so that it’s not seen as an obligation) ask nicely if you may have a gift they gave me a nice bag. Not a purse, but very decent to go shopping!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;chon-inter-hotel&quot;&gt;Chon Inter Hotel&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a shuttle leaving at 5:30 pm to a big mall, and returning at like 7:30pm. Go to the mall and walk to the supermarket at the very end of it to get anything you may have forgotten to buy in the states like for me: light plastic shoes (for the shower), umbrella (to protect yourself from the sun and the rain), nail polish remover (because of the anesthesia) sanitary napkins (Suporn’s brand is said to be uncomfortable), listerine, body wash, and a bed table.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why a bed table? For when you’re back in the hotel! It will be very handy to use your computer in bed, like in the hospital.
At that supermarket, women shoes stop at size 40, but I do question the accuracy because I wear US size 8.5W (or 7M) yet these 40 didn’t even fit me. So make sure to check the shoes fit you!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was told I should have bought chocolate to leave in the room, as it is considered very polite in Thailand. I didn’t know. Sorry!!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;hospital&quot;&gt;Hospital&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once you are admitted, you’ll have about 5 hours by yourself. Use that time to setup your room. Remember, you’ll be bed bound for a week.
There is a flat screen tv but it was too far from the bed so I didn’t bother with it. Instead I put flowers next to it, as it gave a nice vibe to the room&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Instead, I made sure my electrical setup wouldn’t be messed up by nurses or the cleaning team who may want to quickly access a plug and won’t bother with the consequences of unplugging a device, which is bad when you’re stuck in bed and unable to fix that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My rule of thumb: there were 2 plugs, I leave one, and I take one and shrink wrap + duct tape the hell of all my ac adapters so that they can’t be 
removed from the multiplug. The other plug is free for the hospital use. If they want both plugs, they can unplug my duct taped mess and use a multiplug I conveniently left on the shelf (I had a few spares). At least I know the USB adapters won’t be unplugged, as it sometimes happens to me in my bedroom.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If like me you’re traveling alone, your electronics will be your only line of contact with the rest of the world. You want to make damn sure they’ll work regardless of the tampering they’ll be subjected to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I also took the end cables and velcroed them to the bed, so that they never fall out of my reach. Also, I used an elastic to keep my cellphone from hanging. That has been the most handy thing so far. I’ll try to post a picture.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is a safe on a table, then some drawers and your bed. My suggestion is to move your bed as close as possible to this drawer thing, and put anything you may need inside. The first class pack you took from the airplane will come in handy: you’ll get a spare if you don’t like the Aikchol toothbrush (too hard), toothpaste (yucky), etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, put one of the chair next to that: you can put your laptop there when you need the table to eat. I didn’t bother much with the safe - I only put my id cards and my cash in there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my drawer I have multi vitamins, a pen and paper (vital when people don’t understand your accent), a brush (my hair get messy in bed, some makeup, an mp3 player, the Aikchol pack and the Air Korea pack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I hope these small hints can be useful to anyone traveling!&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Staying motivated to Dilate</title>
        <description>&lt;h3 id=&quot;sowe-spent-several-hours-on-an-operating-table-where-a-surgeon-painstakingly-carefully-and-meticulously-cut-up-our-unwanted-genitals-and-did-nifty-genital-origami&quot;&gt;So…we spent several hours on an operating table where a surgeon painstakingly, carefully and meticulously cut up our unwanted genitals and did nifty genital origami&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What? You hate dilating? It’s a total waste of time? &lt;em&gt;Five&lt;/em&gt; times a day ? or &lt;em&gt;Two W(hole) Hours&lt;/em&gt; every day? I know right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I used to think Dilating was a total waste of time and now …well I still haven’t changed my mind. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are so so so so many things I’d rather be doing than fricking dilate. Stuff like&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Actually getting some sleep. Yeah I’m a sleep deprived parent. I sleep only 4-5 hours daily on weekdays and it burns me out. Sorry this blog hasn’t been regularly updated often enough. Sometimes when I dilate late at night (1.30 am?), I fall asleep and miss out on changing my dilator size (always swap out to the larger ones before nodding off!), I wake up, if I am lucky the dilator is still inside me, if I’m not, there’s gunk everywhere, I missed out the dilation time, etc. which sucks.  &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Play. With my spouse or my kids. Time is really so short. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Have a good workout. Heh. yeah. My waistline is a testament of that. Cuz I’m lying on my back instead of having fun outside…&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Socialize in meatspace. Well it’s not so common for people to group-dilate so I guess that’s the tradeoff to having to dilate. It’s a solo thing. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-why-dilate&quot;&gt;So why dilate?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It keeps our system running the way our surgeons designed it. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It prevents stenosis or tightening up and shortening of the vaginal canal which &lt;em&gt;we paid good money for and suffered pain and bleeding for&lt;/em&gt;. After all, who, having bought a Ferrari, would not maintain it in operating condition?&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We can take this time as quiet time or a time of meditation, self-reflection and just rest and relax. It’s pretty good for the soul, really.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;We get to know our anatomy a bit better each time&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a good check that everything is working as it should&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;In case of a desire to receive penetrative vaginal sex in the future, constant dilating, even on the smallest dilator, helps to keep things pain-free and enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;so-now-we-must-dilate-and-dilate-we-must&quot;&gt;So Now We Must Dilate, and Dilate We Must&lt;/h4&gt;

        <title>SRS packing List</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;so-its-almost-time-to-leave-for-srs-and-youre-wondering-whats-good-to-pack-the-following-is-a-generic-list-of-stuff-most-postop-persons-found-useful-and-neccessary-on-their-journey-to-anatomial-womanhood&quot;&gt;So it’s almost time to leave for SRS and you’re wondering what’s good to pack? The following is a generic list of stuff most postop persons found useful and neccessary on their journey to anatomial womanhood&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;tech-stuff&quot;&gt;Tech Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A tablet or a laptop to communicate with folks back home. If traveling light, at least a mobile.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Don’t forget to bring the required power socket adapters and voltage transformers so that your tech stays juiced. It is very miserable running out of battery energy when you are down wounded.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Some women chose to bring a gaming console, especially if they weren’t traveling alone. I personally enjoyed playing the XBox with my friend from Europe who had brought her own xBox along. Also, I kicked her butt at Street Fighter, thanks to my Asian genes /sarcasm.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;WiFi repeater if you are techy and WiFi is free. Configure it in your room before surgery though, it is not that easy focusing or doing things after surgery.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A camera if shooting from your mobile phone isn’t your thing. Or get one of those fancy phones with really great cameras built in.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A pair of earphones or earbuds to plug in and cancel external noise whether on the plane or in recovery or whenever it gets too stressful&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A spare mobile phone if traveling overseas and intending to have a local SIM card&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;surgery-care-stuff&quot;&gt;Surgery Care Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Buy overnight sanitary pads (as long and big as you like) at the location. Buying from home might be unneccsarily heavy or onerous.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A diaper changing mat. Diaper mats are easy to clean, which makes it suitable for dilating on, and for sleeping upon, to prevent bedsheet staining (the costs of cleanup most likelt to be borne by you)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Neosporin or topical antiseptic which is allowed by your own doctor, to help wound recovery&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A small spray-bottle capable of being refilled with betadine, for easy, effective and efficient dispensation of Betadine onto site&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;It is a Good Idea to find out the costs of lube back home, for a comparison against prices provided by the surgical facility or by a local pharmacy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Getting a small container around 5 inches wide can help you hold used dilators within especically if they’re icky with lube . This way they won’t get on your bedding or the floor or get dirty.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;clothes&quot;&gt;Clothes&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Plenty of loose underwear, about 1.5 per day for each day stay.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loose skirts&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Loose pants (not recommended)&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Bras, tops, etc&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Other climate-specific gear suitable for the climate you are entering, including shoes and scarves.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;toiletries&quot;&gt;Toiletries&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Toothbrush and toothpaste&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Personal grooming kit such as razors , creams, makeup, hairbrushes, etc&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spare kitchen towels or toilet paper for just in case&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;wet wipes or baby wipes – lifesaver.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Hair ties are useful especially if showering isn’t permitted for the first few days.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&quot;misc-stuff&quot;&gt;Misc Stuff&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Sunglasses&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Spare zipper bags&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mom/Dad/relative&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A big cloth-based bag for the donut. It’s less conspicuous and makes it easier to carry and also easier to clean, too.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Ice Cream Cold Compress</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I only just discovered that a recent postop/post-orchi candidate can use a tub of ice cream as cold compress over the wound. 
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ice cream can also be eaten when while being used, too, which is pretty cool (haha, punny). Captain Obvious says: That's a real morale booster in times of pain
&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Vaginal Flora</title>
        <description>&lt;h1 id=&quot;nobody-likes-a-smelly-vag-not-even-ourselves&quot;&gt;Nobody likes a smelly vag, not even ourselves&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our newly installed neovagina and neovulva do not have the flora native to natal vulvas and ladybits. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is because throughout the process of surgery and aftercare, the surgeons douse us liberally with antiseptics to prevent infection, and thereafter, we are usually on a dose of antibiotics, which presumably kill off almost &lt;em&gt;all&lt;/em&gt; flora…except the stinky ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One sure sign that we are getting a yeast infection is an unpleasant smell. If our vag stinks like ass, a rotten fish, or even marmite / vegemite, it’s likely we got ourselves a B.V. aka &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacterial_vaginosis&quot;&gt;bacterial vaginosis&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately one of the &lt;em&gt;leading causes&lt;/em&gt; of B.V. is douching. Yup, that activity that surgeons sometimes encourage us to do to flush stuff out. It gets particularly bad if we use betadine or even vinegar as douching solutions because these stuff nuke our good flora along with the bad. The antibiotics we’re usually hopped up on postop don’t help much, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We need more acidophilus types in there, not less. There’s one good solution, which is to buy Intimate Hygiene Washes, particularly those with prebiotics or probiotics in them. The really high-end washes are pretty pricy and come in a foaming bottle but we can buy a foam-making bottle and pour (diluted) washing solution in there to max out our money, because the washing instructions pretty much always instruct users to foam before applying, which is tricky. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can buy those at Walmart for less than $5. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(I’ve made my small bottle last me a whole six months, washing twice a day!$5 never went anywhere as far in my life as this)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;advantages-of-not-being-malodorous&quot;&gt;Advantages of not being malodorous&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Mental Well-being – we can be further in harmony with our new anatomy after our painful rebirth, be more confident and not be so paranoid everyone is smelling fish when we enter the room.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better physical well-being – yes, not having a rash or stinky discharge is pretty nice, plus we don’t have to scrub our undies that hard. whew.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Better love life – most lovers prefer ladybits which don’t smell offensive. &lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;when-should-we-start-or-when-is-it-okay-to-use-a-vaginal-wash&quot;&gt;When should we start or when is it okay to use a vaginal wash?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unless otherwise indicated by your doctor, a good time would be pretty close to the end of your antiobiotic dosage, or when the offensive smell / discharge starts to appear, or when your stitches stop oozing. Usually that would be around the 6 week mark upwards. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s also never too late to use a vaginal wash, no matter how many years postop a person is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;results&quot;&gt;Results&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Please report on your results after trying this. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
