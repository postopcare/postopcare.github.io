## /u/livebeta's dilation tips
[original source](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/3wx55c/dilation_really_hurts_any_tips/)

###A recently postoperative woman asked:###
Tried dilation by myself for the first time today, the nurse kept telling me to relax my muscles but I don't know how to do that when I'm in physical pain. Once it's in there I'm ok but pushing it in is teeth grindingly hard. Any help would be very appreciated!

Hi, (I'm a) Chet's pussy owner. (here was what helped me in having easier dilations)

1. deep breathing exercise. See youtube. Basically you breath in deeply over 1 bar of slow music (4 counts) and out over 4 counts. It's similar to meditative breathing.


2. Bear down. Make like you're going to poop , that relaxes the muscles. Poop beforehand if you're concerned that you may poo during dilation.


3. Half turns, quarter turns. Make sure you have enough lube. Apply pressure and turn/ twist dilator . If it pulls (hurts, no immediate slippage) when twisting, that means you don't have enough lube. Remove dilator, reapply lube. 


4. Take your time. You have the whole day to dilate a total of 30mins x 3. Don't rush. Listen to some quiet, piano music on Youtube. That's how I use music to track time elapsed. 


5. Also, you need to note the exact angles Sri taught you to sit at, so that the dilator goes in. Try not to dilate having taken a powerful painkiller combo of Tramadol+Para, that kills off the feedback and you won't know if you're hurting yourself. 


6. Add: breathing in will create abdominal space, push dilator in  when breathing in
