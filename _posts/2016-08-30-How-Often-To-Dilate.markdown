##It's been a year and more out for me since SRS (and perhaps you, too)

The swelling has long gone down, the pain a vague memory. Life is good. No more genital dysphoria (mostly)

I no longer have to (although I *ought* to) dilate on a daily basis.

How often then should I dilate? Or, how often then should you dilate?

Let your body tell you. If you're losing depth and/or width, that's a sign that your vag isn't getting enough
maintenance so get on it. A sign of losing depth of width is struggling to get the dilators you could previously
accommodate, to the depth you could, given a particular width. Or even simply struggling to get the dilator to enter
(of course having already used enough lube!!! *wince*)


Increase the frequency of dilation until you don't lose depth of width. For myself I did end up
dilating less frequently than every other day , which alarmingly made me lose width *and* depth. That was scary. I restarted
my dilation daily and slowly took it to alternate days, although some weeks, I do end up playing it safe and not skipping any days at all.

I hope you're able to find your own balance between having a life and dilating! Happy dilating!
