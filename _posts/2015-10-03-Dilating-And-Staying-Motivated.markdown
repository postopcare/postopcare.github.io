###So...we spent several hours on an operating table where a surgeon painstakingly, carefully and meticulously cut up our unwanted genitals and did nifty genital origami

What? You hate dilating? It's a total waste of time? *Five* times a day ? or *Two W(hole) Hours* every day? I know right? 


I used to think Dilating was a total waste of time and now ...well I still haven't changed my mind. 

There are so so so so many things I'd rather be doing than fricking dilate. Stuff like

* Actually getting some sleep. Yeah I'm a sleep deprived parent. I sleep only 4-5 hours daily on weekdays and it burns me out. Sorry this blog hasn't been regularly updated often enough. Sometimes when I dilate late at night (1.30 am?), I fall asleep and miss out on changing my dilator size (always swap out to the larger ones before nodding off!), I wake up, if I am lucky the dilator is still inside me, if I'm not, there's gunk everywhere, I missed out the dilation time, etc. which sucks.  

* Play. With my spouse or my kids. Time is really so short. 

* Have a good workout. Heh. yeah. My waistline is a testament of that. Cuz I'm lying on my back instead of having fun outside...

* Socialize in meatspace. Well it's not so common for people to group-dilate so I guess that's the tradeoff to having to dilate. It's a solo thing. 
 
##So why dilate?

1. It keeps our system running the way our surgeons designed it. 


2. It prevents stenosis or tightening up and shortening of the vaginal canal which *we paid good money for and suffered pain and bleeding for*. After all, who, having bought a Ferrari, would not maintain it in operating condition?


3. We can take this time as quiet time or a time of meditation, self-reflection and just rest and relax. It's pretty good for the soul, really.


4. We get to know our anatomy a bit better each time


5. It is a good check that everything is working as it should


6. In case of a desire to receive penetrative vaginal sex in the future, constant dilating, even on the smallest dilator, helps to keep things pain-free and enjoyable.

####So Now We Must Dilate, and Dilate We Must
