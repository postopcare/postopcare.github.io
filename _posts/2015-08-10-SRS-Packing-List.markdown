##So it's almost time to leave for SRS and you're wondering what's good to pack? The following is a generic list of stuff most postop persons found useful and neccessary on their journey to anatomial womanhood##



###Tech Stuff###


* A tablet or a laptop to communicate with folks back home. If traveling light, at least a mobile.

* Don't forget to bring the required power socket adapters and voltage transformers so that your tech stays juiced. It is very miserable running out of battery energy when you are down wounded. 

* Some women chose to bring a gaming console, especially if they weren't traveling alone. I personally enjoyed playing the XBox with my friend from Europe who had brought her own xBox along. Also, I kicked her butt at Street Fighter, thanks to my Asian genes /sarcasm. 

* WiFi repeater if you are techy and WiFi is free. Configure it in your room before surgery though, it is not that easy focusing or doing things after surgery. 

* A camera if shooting from your mobile phone isn't your thing. Or get one of those fancy phones with really great cameras built in.

* A pair of earphones or earbuds to plug in and cancel external noise whether on the plane or in recovery or whenever it gets too stressful


* A spare mobile phone if traveling overseas and intending to have a local SIM card 

###Surgery Care Stuff###

* Buy overnight sanitary pads (as long and big as you like) at the location. Buying from home might be unneccsarily heavy or onerous.

* A diaper changing mat. Diaper mats are easy to clean, which makes it suitable for dilating on, and for sleeping upon, to prevent bedsheet staining (the costs of cleanup most likelt to be borne by you)

* Neosporin or topical antiseptic which is allowed by your own doctor, to help wound recovery

* A small spray-bottle capable of being refilled with betadine, for easy, effective and efficient dispensation of Betadine onto site 

* It is a Good Idea to find out the costs of lube back home, for a comparison against prices provided by the surgical facility or by a local pharmacy. 


* Getting a small container around 5 inches wide can help you hold used dilators within especically if they're icky with lube . This way they won't get on your bedding or the floor or get dirty. 

###Clothes###

* Plenty of loose underwear, about 1.5 per day for each day stay.

* Loose skirts

* Loose pants (not recommended)

* Bras, tops, etc


* Other climate-specific gear suitable for the climate you are entering, including shoes and scarves.


###Toiletries##

* Toothbrush and toothpaste

* Personal grooming kit such as razors , creams, makeup, hairbrushes, etc

* Spare kitchen towels or toilet paper for just in case

* wet wipes or baby wipes -- lifesaver.

* Hair ties are useful especially if showering isn't permitted for the first few days.


###Misc Stuff###

* Sunglasses

* Spare zipper bags

* Mom/Dad/relative

* A big cloth-based bag for the donut. It's less conspicuous and makes it easier to carry and also easier to clean, too.
